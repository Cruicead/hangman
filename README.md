I've only ever modded games up until this task, and certainly had no contact with C# or "proper" programming, so the last three days have been quite an intense learning experience. I hope my work is adequate, especially regarding "best practices". I'm aware of the regular flow of work on GitHub (I've worked with other people on mods), but since I was working alone on this relatively small project, I just committed everything straight to the main branch.

Also, I've realized too late that the intent of the list of requirements was likely to do them one by one and commit at each turn (I was initially confused why the first task asked for making a list of European capitals, and a later one for referring to the attached file, and I assumed that the task had simply been revised later on without 'fixing' previous entries), so I did things out of order, but I hope this is adequate nonetheless; if not, I can do it again from scratch.

I worked in Visual Studio Code on my own machine and uploaded the program folder's contents to GitHub. Program.cs and highscores.txt are the only files I worked on, all the others besides countries_and_capitals.txt have been generated by Visual Studio Code; I'm not sure whether all of them are necessary, but I uploaded everything.
